# ProLang-Interpretter
ProLang is a language built by me for fun, to try and build an interpretter on my own.


## Current Limitations
The number of variables that can stored = range of unsigned/signed int.

## Todo
When functions are created, then scope by modifying the variable_names class to contain parent and child. 
Comments

## Reimplementations pending
Using C++ lists rather than my own classes, for variable names.
